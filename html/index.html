            The other night dear, as I lay sleeping <br>
            I dreamed I held you in my arms <br>
            But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken <br>
            So I hung my head and I cried. <br>
            You are my sunshine, my only sunshine <br>
            You make me happy when skies are gray <br>
            You'll never know dear, how much I love you <br>
            Please don't take my sunshine away <br>
        </p>

            I'll always love you and make you happy, <br>
            If you will only say the same. <br>
            But if you leave me and love another, <br>
            You'll regret it all some day: <br>
            You are my sunshine, my only sunshine <br>
            You make me happy when skies are gray <br>
            You'll never know dear, how much I love you <br>
            Please don't take my sunshine away <br>

            You told me once, dear, you really loved me <br>
            And no one else could come between. <br>
            But not you've left me and love another; <br>
            You have shattered all of my dreams: <br>
            You are my sunshine, my only sunshine <br>
            You make me happy when skies are gray <br>
            You'll never know dear, how much I love you <br>
            Please don't take my sunshine away <br>
        </p>

            In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me <br>
            When I awake my poor heart pains. <br>
            So when you come back and make me happy <br>
            I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame. <br>
            You are my sunshine, my only sunshine <br>
            You make me happy when skies are gray <br>
            You'll never know dear, how much I love you <br>
            Please don't take my sunshine away <br>
        </p>
